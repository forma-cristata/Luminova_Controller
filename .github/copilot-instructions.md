# AI Assistant Instructions for Luminova Controller Codebase
## Core Permissions and Protocols
### üîç **General Keep-in-minds**
- Never summarize your changes if it is redundant. I follow along as you change things. If you must summarize, keep it 100 characters or less.
- If a directory becomes empty due to changes, delete it.
- If a code file becomes redundant, delete it.
- If a code file is not used, delete it.
- If I suggest something is redundant and you agree, remove the redundancy.
- NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND EVER: "npx @biomejs/biome lint --write --unsafe"
- Importing react should look like import React from "react"; tHE LINTER IS OFTEN WRONG ABOUT THIS. IF YOU COULD STOP THE LINTER FROM COMPLAINING ABOUT IT THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THE LINTER IS ALSO WRONG ABOUT IMPORTING REACT AS A TYPE IT IS NOT A TYPE. IT SHOULD ALWAYYYYYSSSSS BE IMPORT REACT FROM "REACT";.
- tHEREFORE STOP DOING THIS, JUST LEAVE THE IMPORT IF NEEDED IGNORE THE LINTER: There is JSX, so React is needed. The linter might be incorrectly flagging this. Let me try removing it to confirm:..... I need to add React back:
- You often place your code fixes inside import statements. Stop doing that.
- SLIDERS NEED THROTTLED FOR ANDROID
- THIS CODEBASE USES EXPO-AUDIO, DO NOT SUGGEST USING EXPO-AV AS IT IS DEPRECATED BY SDK 53.
- Your terminal default path is C:/Users/frisk/Documents/T6_25/Capstone/Luminova_Controller/luminova>
    - You do not need to navigate to this path to suggest commands.
- **LINTER COMMAND**: Use `npm run biome:format-lint` to run the linter and formatter
- IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING IS BROKEN, YOU MUST FIX IT. THE SOLUTION IS NEVER EVER EVER TO DELETE IT.
- **PROMPT FOR REBUILD**: If you make changes to native code (`android`/`ios` directories) or build configurations (`eas.json`, `app.json`, `*.config.js`), you must prompt me to rebuild the app.
### üîç **Codebase Scanning Authority**
- **ALWAYS SCAN**: You have full permission to scan and analyze the entire codebase
- **NO PERMISSION NEEDED**: Never ask for permission to read, analyze, or examine any files
- **PROACTIVE EXPLORATION**: Actively explore the workspace to understand context before making changes
- **CONVERSATION HISTORY**: Always review previous conversation history for context and patterns
### üìö **Context Requirements**
- **HOW TO USE THE UI**: Exists here: services/Info.tsx ... the text in the jsx explains how a user uses the app
- **APPLICATION OVERVIEW**: Treat the Luminova Controller architecture as foundational knowledge
- **COMPONENT RELATIONSHIPS**: Understand the interconnections between all components before making changes
- **PATTERN CONSISTENCY**: Maintain established patterns (SharedStyles, ApiService, etc.)
- **PROJECT GUIDELINES**: Always scan README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md when making changes to understand project context and contribution standards
#### **3. Component Standards**
- **Props Interface**: Always define TypeScript interfaces for props
- **Default Props**: Use ES6 default parameters instead of defaultProps
- **Styling**: Use SharedStyles constants (COLORS, FONTS, DIMENSIONS)
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo() for performance-critical components
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- **Conditional Rendering**: Always use ternary operators (`? :`) instead of logical AND (`&&`) for JSX conditional rendering
- **NO LOGICAL OPERATORS IN JSX**: Never use logical AND (`&&`) or OR (`||`) anywhere in JSX, including component props
- **Key Management**: **NEVER use array indices for React keys** - always use `getStableSettingId()` utility
- **Debouncing**: **ALWAYS use `useDebounce` hook** for input throttling instead of manual delays or state management
#### **4. State Management**
- **Local State**: Use useState for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Use ConfigurationContext for app-wide state
- **Side Effects**: Use useEffect with proper cleanup
- **Performance**: Use useCallback/useMemo for expensive operations
### üßπ **Code Cleanup Protocol**
- **MANDATORY**: Always remove deprecated code when implementing fixes or new features
- **Remove**: Unused state variables, functions, imports, and components
- **Clean**: Old useEffect hooks, event listeners, and temporary debugging code
- **Validate**: Use TypeScript errors and linting to identify deprecated patterns
### üîÑ **Documentation Maintenance Protocol**
#### **After Every Change:**
1. **Update documentation** if changes affect:
   - Component structure or behavior
   - Codebase file structure in any way
   - Navigation flow
   - Data models or interfaces
   - API integration patterns
   - New shared resources or utilities
2. **Document New Patterns:**
   - New component types or architectures
   - Additional optimization techniques
   - Changed development workflows
   - Updated troubleshooting information
3. **Maintain Accuracy:**
   - Remove references to deleted/deprecated components/files/functions/hooks.
   - Deleted components/files/functions/hooks/etc. deprecated by your changes.
   - Update file paths if components are moved
   - Revise feature descriptions for modified functionality
   - Keep animation pattern lists current
### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Standards**
#### **Before Making Changes:**
- If the prompt uses all capital letters, summarize our conversation history.
- Scan related components to understand dependencies
- Check for existing patterns in SharedStyles.ts and ApiService.ts
- Review similar implementations in the codebase
- Consider impact on navigation flow and state management
- **Scan README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md** for project context and contribution standards
- NOTE THAT YOUR MASTER NEVER EVER WANTS TO USE EXPO-AV AS IT IS DEPRECATED BY SDK 53.
#### **During Implementation:**
- Use established patterns (COMMON_STYLES, COLORS, FONTS)
- Leverage ApiService for all API communications
- Follow component organization standards
- Maintain TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- **CRITICAL**: Use `getStableSettingId()` from `@/src/utils/settingUtils` for all React keys involving Settings
#### **After Implementation:**
- Validate changes with get_errors tool
- Update documentation to reflect changes
- Test component integration patterns
- Verify no broken imports or dependencies
- **Check git status** after staging to verify changes are correct
### üìã **Codebase Context Summary**
#### **Core Application:**
- **Type**: React Native LED controller app with Expo SDK 53
- **Architecture**: Component-based with centralized state and services
- **Hardware Integration**: REST API communication with LED hardware
- **Data Flow**: FileSystem persistence ‚Üí Context state ‚Üí API communication
#### **Key Components:**
- **16-dot LED grid** representation (2 rows of 8)
- **12 animation patterns** with real-time preview
- **HSV color picker** with gesture controls
- **Carousel-based settings** management
- **API service layer** for hardware communication
#### **Optimization Status:**
- ‚úÖ InfoButton component (reusable across screens)
- ‚úÖ SharedStyles system (centralized theming)
- ‚úÖ Button style consolidation (consistent UI)
- ‚úÖ API service layer (unified error handling)
- ‚úÖ Animation state isolation (prevents bleeding)
#### **Critical Patterns:**
- Use `COMMON_STYLES` for consistent styling
- Use `ApiService` for all API calls
- Use `ConfigurationContext` for global state
- Use `AnimatedDots` for all animation previews
- Use `getStableSettingId()` from `@/src/utils/settingUtils` for all React component keys
- Follow navigation parameter typing in index.tsx
### üîß **LINT FIX Protocol**
#### **Protocol Steps:**
1. **Run linter** to identify all issues in src directory using `npx @biomejs/biome lint src/screens/<fileName>.<fileExtension>` one at a time until there are no errors when you run `npm run biome:format-lint-org` and 'npm run lint'
2. **Group issues by file** to fix them systematically
3. **Fix one file at a time** with the following priority:
   - Remove unused imports (safest fixes first)
   - Fix TypeScript any types
   - Remove unused parameters/variables
   - Fix code complexity issues
   - Address hook rule violations
4. **Validate each fix** with get_errors tool
5. **Confirm with user** before proceeding to next file
6. **Re-run linter** after each file to ensure no new issues
#### **When User Types "LINT FIX":**
1. Automatically run `npm run format-lint`
2. Parse terminal output to identify files with issues
3. Start with the first file containing issues
4. Fix all issues in that file
5. Validate the fixes
6. Ask user: "Fixed [filename]. Continue to next file? (y/n)"
7. Repeat until all files are clean
#### **Systematic Approach:**
- Fix issues in order of complexity (simple to complex)
- Always maintain existing functionality
- Use established patterns from codebase
- Document any significant changes made
- Never delete broken code - always fix it
#### **useCallback Wrapper Fix Protocol (Successfully Applied to AnimatedDots Aug 2025):**
1. **Create temporary instructions file** for complex multi-function fixes
2. **Wrap each animation function individually** in useCallback hooks
3. **Fix dependency arrays systematically** - add missing deps, remove unnecessary ones
4. **Test after each major group** of fixes with `npm run format-lint`
5. **Order of operations**: Function wrapping first, then dependency array fixes
6. **Common patterns**: Animation functions need COLOR_COUNT, avoid setHasChanges in deps
7. **Utility functions** like `random()` also need useCallback wrapping
8. **Clean up**: Remove temp files and update docs when complete
### üéØ **Response Guidelines**
If you run out of tool attempts, continue automatically iterating. Don't require prompting to continue.
#### **Always Do:**
- Scan workspace before responding
- Reference established patterns
- Update documentation after changes
- Validate implementations
- Consider component relationships
- **Check git status** after staging changes to verify correctness
- **COMMIT AND PUSH**: After completing any task, run `git commit -am "<INSERT COMMIT MESSAGE>"; git push` to save changes
#### **Commit Message Guidelines for AI:**
- **Single sentence rule**: Commit messages must be no longer than one sentence
- **Multi-line format**: Use title + bullet points for complex changes
- **Include scope**: Specify which components/screens were modified
- **Be descriptive**: Clearly explain what was changed and impact
- **Examples**:
  ```
  ‚úÖ "Add responsive scaling to InfoButton for iPhone 16 Plus compatibility"
  ‚úÖ "Fix LedToggle positioning and sizing for cross-device consistency"
  ```
#### **Never Do:**
- Ask permission to scan files
- Ignore existing patterns
- Make changes without understanding context
- Skip documentation updates
- Break established component interfaces
### ÔøΩ **Key Management Protocol**
#### **CRITICAL RULE: Never Use Array Indices for React Keys**
Using array indices as React keys causes:
- ‚ùå "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" errors during scrolling
- ‚ùå Component state loss during list reordering
- ‚ùå Unnecessary re-renders and performance issues
#### **Always Use Stable Key Generation:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use stable content-based keys
import { getStableSettingId } from "@/src/utils/settingUtils";

{settingsData.map(item => (
  <SettingBlock
    key={getStableSettingId(item)}  // ‚úÖ Stable, unique key
    setting={item}
  />
))}

// ‚ùå NEVER DO: Use array indices
{settingsData.map((item, index) => (
  <SettingBlock
    key={index}  // ‚ùå BAD: causes rendering issues
    key={`item-${index}`}  // ‚ùå BAD: still index-based
  />
))}
```
#### **Key Management Rules:**
1. **Always use `getStableSettingId()`** for Setting-related components
2. **Never use array indices** as keys when list order can change
3. **Ensure keys persist** across re-renders
4. **Use content-based hashing** for deterministic key generation
#### **üö® CRITICAL: "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" Error Debugging Protocol**
**When user reports this error, follow this EXACT search methodology:**

1. **DON'T look for logical AND (`&&`) operators first** - they're rarely the cause
2. **DON'T assume it's array indices in React keys** - that's a different issue
3. **DO search for stray characters/text outside JSX elements** using these patterns:

**Search Commands to Run:**
```bash
# Look for stray text/characters between JSX closing and opening tags
grep -r "\}[^;}\s\)]+[^<]*\{" src/

# Look for direct text content in JSX that isn't wrapped in Text components
grep -r "\>[^<\{\s][^<\{]*[a-zA-Z][^<\{]*\<" src/

# Look for string interpolations that might render as text
grep -r "\{[^}]*[\"'`][^\"'`}]*[\"'`][^}]*\}" src/components/
```

**Common Culprits:**
- **Stray space characters**: `{" "}` rendered directly in JSX
- **Template literals in JSX**: `` {`some text`} `` without Text wrapper
- **String expressions**: `{someString}` rendered directly
- **Comments that become text**: Malformed comment syntax

**Real Example (September 2025):**
Found `{" "}` stray space in ColorWheel.tsx line 251:
```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG (causes error)
                ))}{" "}
                {/* comment */}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT
                ))}
                {/* comment */}
```

**Priority Search Areas:**
1. Components used in the screen with the error
2. Child components of those components
3. Any components with complex JSX structure
4. Recently modified files

**DEBUGGING LESSON (September 2025):** The error is almost always caused by **stray text characters or strings rendered directly in JSX** without proper Text component wrapping, NOT logical operators or React keys.

## DOCS Workflow

When you receive the exact prompt text: **"DOCS"**

### Process:
1. Check for unstaged changes using git status
2. Analyze the modified files to understand what has changed using git diff <filePath>
3. Document the changes in `.github/README.md*` and '.github/docs/<anywhere applicable>

### Documentation Guidelines:
- Be brief and succinct
- No emojis
- Focus on what changed and why it matters
- Include technical details relevant to the change type
- Use clear, direct language
- Organize changes logically within the existing document structure
- Do not summarize yourself in the chat window.

### Output Format:
- Add changes to existing sections where appropriate
- Create new sections if the change represents a new category
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing documentation
- Include relevant code examples or configuration snippets when helpful
- Remove obsolete/deprecated documentation in favor of your updated sections.

## COMMIT Workflow

When you receive the exact prompt text: **"COMMIT"**

### Process:
1. Check for unstaged changes and new/deleted files using git status
2. Use git diff <filePath> to analyze the modified files and their modifications
3. Generate a concise, descriptive commit message using scripts/README.md to determine if versioning needs updated (<commit-message>), that accurately reflects the changes made in 10 words or fewer.
4. Run "git add .; git commit -m '<commit-message>'; git push" to commit and push the changes.
